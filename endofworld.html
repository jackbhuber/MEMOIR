<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="phoenix-az-1982-1995">Phoenix, AZ, 1982-1995</h3>
<p>Sometime close to 1982, when I was 10 years old, we moved to Phoenix, Arizona. My father landed a job as the Head Professional at a city golf course in Phoenix. We moved a few times.</p>
<p>These were my adolescent and teenage years. This was a time of difficult growing and transition for me. I have more than a few painful memories of these years. This was also a time of intensive religious formation for me.</p>
<p>My father’s midlife crisis</p>
<p>I took it on faith that Jesus “died for our sins” so that we could go to heaven and not hell, a place of eternal conscious torment.</p>
<p>Our home, like most Evangelical homes, was a biblical home. We saw the Bible as the inerrant Word of God. It was to be interpreted literally with a plain reading. The Bible was the authority. All this was taken for granted. Surely there was some verse that we could lift out of context to apply to our own needs. We went to churches and watched religious television that reinforced this. With no exposure to other Christian traditions or hermeneutics, we really had no reason to question it. I never wondered where the Bible actually came from.</p>
<p>Prophecy was a part of my experience. My mother was an avid viewer of religious television, particularly Trinity Broadcasting Network with Paul and Jan Crouch where Hal Lindsey was a regular guest and offered his latest prophecies based on current events. I lived with the hope of being swept up in the Rapture and the fear of being left behind to go through the Tribulation. I was also afraid of being annihilated at any time by nuclear war with the Russians.</p>
<p>From the sixth grade through half of seventh, I attended a private Evangelical school where I had many difficult times with peers. In my science class I learned about creation and evolution and in my history class I learned about dispensationalism. From seventh grade through half of ninth, I was home-schooled. When I entered high school, I found that I excelled academically but was very socially deficient.</p>
<p>Looking back on these years, I had the kind of faith I was taught to have: a healthy reverence and respect for the Almighty Father and a&nbsp; “personal relationship with Jesus.” I prayed with some frequency. I believed as a historical fact everything found in the Bible and viewed every commandment and exhortation in it as binding to all people worldwide throughout all of human history. I believed that Jesus “died for my sins” and that the point of Christianity was to go to heaven and not hell. I hoped to be swept up in the Rapture and feared being left behind for the Tribulation. I believed in a supernatural realm of God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, angels, demons, and Satan which actively influence human thoughts, emotions, attitudes, behavior, and thus human history, and that history was heading nowhere good. In these respects, fear was a very important part of my faith. The God in which I believed was a god who wanted obedience and would severely judge those who disobeyed. Above all else, God was a god of judgment.</p>
<p>I grew up in a world oriented toward salvation. There were two kinds of people in the world: the saved and the damned. And for all the scorn my family had toward Catholics for “rituals”, what separated the saved from the damned in our world was one ritual: the Sinner’s Prayer.</p>
<p>By this measure I was “saved” more times growing up than I can remember. The one I most remember was at a high school winter camp. A group of us high school kids from our church retreated to a camp in the mountains where we slept in cabins and spent much of our time playing games, singing songs in worship, and hearing sermons. On our final night, the youth pastor gave a compelling sermon, and this was followed by a period of quiet music and a pastor’s voice gently inviting us to “give our lives once more to Jesus,” especially as repentance from some sin. It worked on me. The sin about which I felt particularly guilty was a rock album: Rush, Moving Pictures. Moved by the music and wracked with guilt, I rose from my spot in the crowd and tiptoed my way to the side where one of several youth pastors was waiting to receive wayward young souls. When I sobbed my “confession” of listening to Satanic rock music and he helped me through a prayer of repentance, the look on his face gave me the distinct sense that he was working very hard to conceal his amusement.</p>
<p>This memory attests to my teenage faith. I truly believed that I had sinned, that I had gone against what God wanted of me. But I also truly believed that God forgave sin, and that from wherever I had gone, I could come back to Jesus.</p>
